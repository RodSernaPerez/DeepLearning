The teacher's union suggestion to change the schools name is ludicrous!"
22404,"I think what happened is that the Trumps campaign created Pizzagate in order to retaliate against Clinton for all of the women coming forward and saying that Trump had raped and molested them.    Trump felt that Clinton was behind all of these women coming forward at the 11th hour of the campaign to accuse him.   So no doubt his campaign probably decided to smear her too with sex abuse allegations.

This will easily go down in history as the dirtiest, most ugly political campaign the United States has ever had."
23397,"Canada has a unique opportunity to improve and enlarge its IT sector significantly given the large number of talented IT professionals from abroad whose plan to seek a US Green Card or to renew a Green Card has been thrown into doubt by confused and discriminatory immigration policies of the Trump Administration.  The Federal Government has put in place several measures to attract IT enterprises to locate or expand in Canada to take advantage of this foreign and the Canadian domestic IT talent pool.

This announcement by Silicon Valley Bank is evidence that this Federal initiative is bearing fruit.

Now if Canadian Federal, Provincial and Local Governments could only seriously address the urban residential real estate bubble, then these incomers (and Canadian IT folks) could actually find places to live."
25058,"Thanks, Bob. What a great quote! It reminds me of the best homily I ever heard on the 'Good Samaritan' parable. The priest said that we all like to cast ourselves in the role of the Samaritan because he gets to be the hero, but the reality is that we must also cast ourselves in the role of the guy in the ditch who is put in the position of having to accept kindness from an enemy. It's in the humility of realizing that we must be takers as well as givers -- that we are all interdependent -- that barriers come down and enemies become friends. That is where God is found."

7790,"CNN News;

The 42nd president on Wednesday, while stumping in Orlando for Hillary Clinton, suggested Trump’s campaign rallying cry, “Make America Great Again,” is racist code. 

“I’m actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they weren’t all that good in many ways,” Clinton said. “That message where ‘I’ll give you America great again’ is if you’re a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, don’t you?”

The problem is, Clinton himself has used the same phrase several times in the past.
He used it repeatedly while running for president in 1991 and 1992, declaring at one Little Rock, Ark., event, ""Together, we can make America great again."" 

And in a campaign ad for his wife in 2008, Bill Clinton said, ""It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again."" 

“Only the aspirants for president are fool enough to believe what they read in the newspapers”.  Christopher Hitchens"

19043,"If Alaska oil laws are so good why don’t you or any of your friends drill for oil?

Alaska, keeps changing the laws and tax system so no one can plan or depend on the state for a stable forecast.

Alaska needs to be dependable and stable, so use the PFD or savings and count this oil price crisis as a raining day so use your savings to outlast the attack by a Saudi Glut!

If investing in oil was so good why are companies like APACHE leaving Alaska? Why are oil companies losing money in Alaska, with no profits?

Why has production dropped 90% in the Cook Inlet? Why has the North Slope dropped 1.5 million barrels?

Here is the BIG QUESTION, If Alaska is offering such a great deal to oil drillers then why don’t we have any Alaskans that drilled and sold oil at a profit? Alaska needs a massive overhaul so Alaskans can drill and stop the monopoly the majors have! Alaska is so ugly that the state’s own people will not invest in exploration and production, NOT ONE Since statehood, why?"

22246,"overspending like the stimulus package - or how about that TARP that Bush had to pass in late 2008 that added to Obama's budget deficit? You're kidding right?  Both of those SAVED us.  And how does over regulating contribute to decrease tax revenue?  I mean - isn't that what you Republicans are all about - don't want to pay taxes for what you get.  Want to get all the government benefits surrounding us such as roads and transportation, snow plowing, police and fire fighting, libraries, parks, subsidized gas, etc etc etc.  In fact government is the framework that businesses and individuals operate but you Republicans don't want to pay.  The funny thing is that red states take more from the federal government than they give while blue states give more than they take.  Those Republicans in red Oklahoma love the disaster relief from tornadoes or farmers with their subsidies.  Try to get out of that tiny dark GOP box, back away from extreme partisanship and educate yourself about the truth."

15947,"Not sure homophobia is a good way to describe something I have such an outwardly indifferent attitude towards.  Is the human species intended to pair heterosexually?  In my opinion yes, and I believe God had this intention.  Is the infrequent diversion from this norm bad in and of itself?  F**k if I know! 

The bible does reference it very little and I realize my posts seem very cut and dry.  Beyond the above reasoning I can't say or argue definitively what the role of monogamous homosexual relationships are within the church or what Gods view on them are.  That's why it's just my opinion, not some fact I'm going to use in manipulating others.  I think you are doing a disservice by equating disagreement with intolerance. 

 If I rarely drank your favorite kind of beer would you call me intolerant toward your preference? No, we would say ""huh, we like different things in a way that literally affects nothing"".  I believe a biblical stance on LBGT would have a similar impact to society."

She is living on 'stolen land' and enjoying the benefits of previous generations of immigrants as much as anyone else. She should move somewhere where no person has every stepped foot and live off the land.

3931,"Your reasoning here Paul22 is transparently stupid. Donald Trump is a billionaire and therefore a member of a greedy elite that has purchased leverage in the American people's political system so that he can take advantage of the working majority for his personal gain whereas Mr. Hecker is an average citizen who lacks the money to purchase advantages in America's political system. To the extent that the ideal citizen becomes that of Trump-like people versus people like Mr. Hecker this nation is not long for this world. 
The French knew what to do with people like Trump and their nation has been better of ever since. Perhaps too few Americans possess the nobility of character required for the people to take back what rightfully is theirs. The vulgar minions of the superrich feign rebellion but are entirely servile. The question is are average Americans also naturally servile? To the rich who have absconded with our democracy taxation could fulfill the function of the guillotine."

15107,"Published ""official"" inflation rates (CPI etc) are artificial misinformation tools used for manipulative purposes.  By adjusting the basket of goods and services on which they are calculated, almost any desired rate can be produced.

If, for example, increases in the Guaranteed Income Supplement were pegged to the actual rate of inflation faced by low income seniors, including increases in the basics on which they spend the majority of their meagre income (like food) rather than being pegged to the artificial construct of the CPI, the government would face a much larger bill, wouldn't it?"
3673,"The bishop's remarks are pathetic.  Just more of the same ""mistakes were made"" line.  This was not a failure of knowledge or leadership.  This was the knowing and intentional commission of evil by clergy and the bishops to further their careers and protect the institution.  

Whatsoever you do to the least, so you do unto me?  Sound familiar?  Put into context, priests, brothers and others in the church raped Jesus Christ, bishops aided and abetted the rape of Jesus Christ, and popes, including a pair of purported saints, aided and abetted the rape of Jesus Christ. 

So this lent, lets dispense with a reading of the crucifixion of Christ 2000 years ago and read about the crucifixion of Christ by the Catholic Church in the 20th and 21st Centuries."

Is this worth a recall? Yes because even they are not stupid enough to not know how people would react. Keeping that in mind as a demonstration of their contempt for taxpayers they instead embrace the idea and have staff look into it. This bunch has turned a 3rd rate fools party into a first rate fools party. When you get a chance soon I hope sign on for the recalls.  . Oh by the way.

It's ranked quite highly now, and everybody takes credit for my development work, but I don't need fame. I watched children become wonderful thinking adults.

As a couple of comments that have followed: “post-pubescent” and (Bill Donohue) “skewing numbers”, it would be worthwhile to note the process of justice. If the person who comes to claim he was molested as a boy raises a case, then one of the three conditions must be met: Was not age of consent; sodomy is/was unlawful/criminal; he was either induced willful/un-willfully or un-induced into un-willful act (rape.) If however what followed was: not being forced, not induced, or not un-induced un-willfully (thus no form of rape), he was at the age of consent at the time (thus no statutory rape), and there were no laws outlawing sodomy, then nothing criminal occurred."

I would agree that many who claim to be Christians often demonstrate quite un-Christlike behavior.  Look to the person of Jesus himself, and ignore the hypocrites, who Jesus himself warned about."

19361,"Allowing the proliferation of disease vectors that blind, deform and kill human children because you think ""kitties are CUTE"" clearly demonstrates lack of compassion.  Toxoplasmosis causes up to 5,000 stillborn, blind, microcephalic, hydrocephalic and otherwise deformed and disabled infants each year in the US alone.

I recall one fatal moose-stomping in Anchorage in, IIRC, 2004.  As for the recent fatal bear-maulings, note the tag-line to the article: ""Rick Sinnott is a FORMER Alaska Department of Fish and Game wildlife biologist"".  He's retired.

But since you emphasize ""compassion"", how do you suggest our native wildlife be ""controlled""?  Any apex predator that looks sideways at a human is shot--and rightly so.  That not enough for you?  Would you advocate killing them all?  I won't agree to that.

Causes of community violence tends to be socioeconomic in nature. Police brutality and inadequate police resourcing (for whatever reason) are very different issues and in my view are not comparable.

""Taking a knee"" is a peaceful, respectful and dignified protest action...it conveys a powerful message without damaging any infrastructure or anyone. 
However it does allow prominent political leaders to fuel patriotic outrage and practice subterfuge & obfuscation of real issues...e.g. gun control...now the lack thereof is something worth being outraged about... #LasVegasShooting"

You don't need to sell me on the stupidity of the Browns, BTW.  That whole move made no sense to me.  I get that they had like 100 million in cap money (how that's even possible is head-shaking in itself), but converting 16M of it to acquire a 2nd round pick just strikes me as a really bad deal.

People say it's weird to fire a warning shot in the air...maybe.....but that's how many people scare bears off their property. Clearly I wasn't there to witness this incident, but it seems like it would have been quicker to jump in your car with your child than it would be pulling your gun out of the holster and shooting at the dog. Also, it bothers me that he had a loaded gun on his hip while he was unpacking his car. REALLY? WHY? I wouldn't want this man and his family to be my neighbors.

However, I understand your concern about every armed person making the right choice in the use of deadly force, especially those afflicted with mental/emotional, prejudicial, and disability issues. And yes, there are those who spoil for a fight and those who accept the invitation to fight.
In the gun culture circles in which I associate, our mantra is, the best gun fight is the one that never happened. Conflict avoidance and escape, if at all possible, is best. Only in the case of there being no escape, and wherein an attack is clearly imminent, the attacker has the means, the attack would likely result in serious injury or death, AND there has been no incitement on the part of the victim(s) is the use of deadly force lawful by civilians."

And some, not just transgender people, join for the  medical care.

I knew a family (because our daughter had cancer) who joined the military so that their son (who was already diagnosed with cancer, could have the best medical care.  So what you and your MAGAphant lapdogs are saying is that you'd like to decide who, and for what treatments, should be covered by medical insurance.

They showed zero regard for my concerns and plowed ahead with their scorched earth policy. Unbeknownst to them, there are people, like me, who would rather accept a trimming of their trees, rather than have them cut completely to the ground and destroyed. As far as I am concerned Chugach Electric and Carlos Tree Service have BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS over this incident. When a person can't enjoy the privacy of their own home and the trees on their property, because of CORPORATE INTERESTS to the contrary, then a person has a right to duly defend his property.

He was so naive he actually believed DC Politicians were more like local pols who could be bought off and were eager for development.

""The events of this week are revealing with a new level of clarity that President Trump and the White House have ventured far beyond unconventional levels of dishonesty. Instead, they are revealing on their part something more remarkable and challenging to our system: a kind of deep rot of bad faith — a profound contempt for democratic process and the possibility of agreement on shared reality — that is wildly beyond anything in recent memory and strains the limits of our political vocabulary."""
28881,"A deal is possible if we can get NK to the table. Trump to his credit is trying to do this despite criticism. He has suggested backing away from SK, for example, and withdrawing troops, and the THAAD system. NK has a rare chance with Trump and SK both asking for a peaceful accord with NK. Trump has a lot of carrots to offer since we have virtually zero trading and investment presence in NK (which Trump's people have noted), and he can leave the Chinese behind if they do not get on the bandwagon and let us lead. Things like aid and investment, pulling US troops, recognizing NK, supporting Chinese aid and investment (if they get with the program and let the US lead this effort). All of this would take skillful negotiation to make a deal and get NK concessions to match our carrots (Trump has not show this ability, but maybe he has learned and will not leave this to Bannon and Kushner)-- he should consult with negotiators from Clinton, Bush and Obama administration to get some ideas."

It seems for less money we could make the road a bit safer.  We just returned from UK and did extensive driving there - they use cameras - when you approach an area with camera surveillance there is a notification sign letting drivers know and if you have a gps in your car it notifies you and posts the speed limit.  We were told the cameras work well and tickets are issued and that it frees up law enforcement for more important issues.

    Another volume by General Privratsky might be written about U.S. logistics and military equipment management in its own distant American-Afghanistan war.  Most likely and very sadly, such an honest study would have to be written by a non-American military general officer, perhaps by a Russian.  To return the favor, the DoD could ask the Russian military for the privilege of writing a parallel logistics study on the equally disastrous Soviet-Afghanistan war.

So how our farms grow with this contradiction in order to compete is the problem.
The other side of the coin, is the cost of growing to that size, the americans have had 40 plus years of unrestricted growth and Canada would have to catch up really quickly( likely a 10 year phase out at best).That would require a huge amount of capital borrowed, and with milk prices currently in the gutter with projections that they are going to stay there banks may not take the risk.

""The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable...""

No one denies the role they played, just that the majority that built this wonderful country were of European descent.  These people shed blood and lost lives in many wars to defend our democracy. 

Just look at the sheer numbers, the majority were of European descent.  This, more than anything, is what has allowed them to play a major role in shaping Canada.  If you want to call it privilege, then so be it.  But that privilege has come about at a huge cost to their lives.

The UH study says 37% of fish consumed locally comes from Hawaii fisheries, with the remainder from imported sources. The same study says that around 20% of Hawaii's catch is exported out of the State (mostly to US mainland). The same study also says that Hawaii's seafood consumption is twice the national average. Your conclusion that the expansion of the monument will support local fisheries is also not supported by any peer reviewed study, if fact the scientific literature says the opposite. Fish spawning in the NWHI are not providing any benefits to fish populations occurring in the MHI due to prevailing currents moving east to west. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna are not staying within the boundaries of the monument and to say that they will stay and get fat within the monument boundaries is a lie to serve your anti-fishing agenda."

So, is Fra von Rumerstein “named” interim leader by the Pope or was Fra von Rumerstein slated to fill that role anyway under the KofM charter and the choice of the KofM Sovereign Council?  And, will he still be responsible for the order’s government after the special delegate is named by Pope Francis?  Put another way, will the special delegate oversee the order’s government and spiritual renewal or only the spiritual renewal.

. . . in other words, non-compete clauses are in many cases less about   . . .trade secrets [and more about] tying  to their current employers, unable to  bargain for better wages or quit to take better jobs.""

For a family with a couple of kids, or more, buying healthy ingredients is often simply more than they can afford.

One commentator said that if they want to eat this way then let them.

A desperate move based on inept planning.  Those that have stayed at EQ only do so since the 2% is still above market, in general.

While Stephen still clings to the delusion of a ZANC honest & probity revival (like the thin man hiding inside the obese glutton), the ZANC is far too compromised and far too captured.  Of its some 400,000 members at unbanning, assuming them all were committed to service to the country, many have retired, died, emigrated or joined oppositions  (UDM, Cope, DA, Agang, Numsa), they are heavily outvoted and outmaneuvered in the one million plus membership today, most of whom are careerists, opportunists o those who ""never joined the struggle to be poor"".

The ZANC's internal power struggles will become irrelevant as it becomes clear that, apart from their inherent dishonest, their hostility to business is killing the economy and destroying jobs.  The ""dirty voters"" can SEE their abandonment."

14657,"Liberals tend to be rich and well off.  They (IMHO) like to think of themselves as good and others as bad.  Nevertheless, they look out for themselves first.  For example, one of the most serious problems for blacks is the criminal justice system.  A significant percentage get slapped with some felony level crime that comes with poverty and oppression.  But the liberals are perfectly happy with a criminal justice system which locks up a black man for years for robbing $200 bucks from a convenience store thus destroying his family and perverting the lives of his children.  Moreover, he is publicly labelled a felon for life with no chance for redemption to record-free status and relegated via ""background checks"" to menial jobs for life.  You don't hear the liberals complaining about this system or work to change it to one in which rehabilitation and redemption is the focus.  So the liberals (or actually fake liberals compared to the past) sputter on uselessly about white supremacists."

So frigging disappointing but not at all surprising, that that weasel and lowest common denominator Trump, has yet again refused to acknowledge and condemn this violent ruddy act of ""radical White Nationalist terrorism"" in Virginia!!!  Isn't this the same campaign candidate Trump, who could not or would not or flatly refused the political support/endorsement of the KKK too???  Bottom line: because Trump and his Administration have positioned themselves as the true and real representatives and supporters of white nationalists, that in turn, make up a large part of Trump's political support base, NO way will anyone ever hear that weak sleazebag Trump ever risk further offending his support base by ever calling them out for anything."

In the interest of transparency, when the UA investigation is finished, they should release all the evidence/documentation of the procedings (with student names redacted). UA should also communicate the burden of proof required for student code of conduct violations. Expelling this student and denying him a degree from UAF is a very serious punishment. Personally, I would rather the review board conduct a thorough investigation and get it right. Adding a community member (i.e. non UA personnel) with a legal or LE background to future review boards would help ease concerns about the role of ""politics"" in these cases.

What would have happened if that agitated mother bear had continued down the trail and encountered someone--say a child--less able to defend him/herself?

Trump has three more months to parade his ignorance, his prejudices and his emotional unfitness to be President.  Likely, he will do so at every opportunity.  Can you imagine the Trump/Clinton debates?  His advisors are, at this very moment, likely working to find a way ""out"" of those events.

Whether or not we're getting our fair share for the oil is no longer the relevant question. We stuck with the ELF for way too long. We ended our income tax, so we had to spend most of the oil revenues to pay the bills, rather than banking more of it. We've used the earnings ONLY to pay dividends. All those chickens are coming home to roost. However you do the ""fair share"" math, production continues to fall. Even 100 percent of nothing is ... nothing. Had we fixed ELF in time and followed the Norwegian model the fund would be much larger now; we could have nice dividends AND pay the bills. Now we have to deal with the situation we created. Fix the oil taxes, but don't expect that to save us."

In short, Catholics unhesitatingly affirm the historicity of the Gospels always in such a fashion that they have told us the honest truth about Jesus. I suspect that the ""fashion"" word means ""genre."" I took this from the Vatican's catechism pages today. I put this catechetical assessment of the Gospels in the same class as a ""modern"" argument of history. This makes room for a ""super-modern"" argument for holding a critical analysis of history. That super-modern genre would be open to asserting that the Transfiguration never actually happened, but Matthew's literary style sure helps provide the great unwashed masses with some darn good imagery about how the Son of God, The Law, and the Prophets sync up in the life and times of Jesus with his 3 key guys as witnesses, but without Matthew, the author."

If this teacher is a science teacher, he must be aware of the simple principles of relative risk assessment.  What is the probability of harmful side effects compared to the probability of (1) contracting the illness that the vaccine is intended to prevent and (2) the probability of serious consequences from that illness?  We take risks every day; we weigh them against the benefits of whatever we choose to do: having a shower, for example.  Medical interventions are no different.  For a healthy adult, the risks of contracting the flu may be low enough that the flu shot is not indicated.  For children and seniors, the risk assessment might well indicate the desirability of the vaccination.  For most vaccinations, the risk of a harmful side effect is less than the risk of being struck by lightening!  For vulnerable individuals, a bout of flu can be fatal."

I suspect the bishops know we're out there.  I  suspect they wish they could draw us back in.  But they lack the tools: tools that take a long time to forge, I sight as to what problems the tools might solve, and above all, the courage to take a risk.  And their lack of a willingness to take a risk for hose who left is often at the very core of why we left.  Be it accountability, be it a refusal to be willing to accept that there Is more than a sixth-grade viewpoint about Jesus that can be acceptable, or even something as simple as recognizing wisdom in the laity, what's needed is some movement, some risk-taking on their part too..."

25880,"Robert Reich part 1

Berkeley professor Robert Reich has not been shy about calling Donald Trump out for all of his nauseating actions and statements.

Now that chief White House strategist and hate speech publisher Steve Bannon has given himself a seat at the national Security Council, Reich spelled out in plain English the real reason we need to be very afraid of Bannon’s ascent to power.

Wrote Reich, “Here’s the big worry. Trump is unhinged and ignorant. Bannon is nuts and malicious. If not supervised by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, their decisions could endanger the world. In Trump’s and Bannon’s view, foreign relations is a zero-sum game. If another nation gains, we lose. As Trump declared at his inaugural: ‘From this day forward, it’s going to be only America First.’ Some of you are old enough to recall John F. Kennedy’s inaugural, when the young president pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the safety of the people."

His need for adoration, being looked at, literally, as in the expression on people's faces, and talked about in glowingly parallel terms in speech or in writing.

When they don't get it and they react vindictively, as Trump routinely does, it is called ""narcissistic injury.""   

His lack of a core center that contains an authentic self is what drives the continuous changes in his views, because he ""mirrors"" others, pretty much whoever he last spoke with that provided the necessary ""narcissistic supply.""    

Had the DSM not eliminated the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder from the cluster Bs, I'd bet a lot of money that Trump would be the poster child for NPD.  But the APA included NPD in the criteria for anti-social personality disorder recently, which identifies them ""sociopaths.""

I'm certain there were other much larger groups expressing their dissatisfaction by threatening to exercise their right to spend money elsewhere also.

27749,"America has already seen the extremes government will go to protect big oil. 
Dispacing the natives for oil or gold has a long history in America. If the brutalities witnessed were initiated against the people of Bismarck I'm sure the media would be singing a different tune. Media blackouts exist. Just like the media blackout concerning oil revenue, oil taxation that is no doubt withering in committee 
People cry that the media is biased. It is. If it weren't the whole of the nation would've witnessed the abuses ,not just the social media.
When big oil gets desperate enough I'm sure an armed response would be viewed differently than a peaceful response from the natives. 
Make America great again by throwing the bribed out of congress not putting them in office where they select an oil exec as Secretary of State. Russia has an involvement. There is a reason they blocked the foreign contributions disclosure. Follow the money.

If someone is hell bent on killing a bunch of people, then they will kill a bunch of people. Although this was a horrible thing that happened, we need to keep it in perspective.  The media likes to play on our fears.  In Chicago this year alone over 1000 people have been shot and more than 700 have died from shootings.  The majority of these shootings in Chicago are from hand guns.  In 2017 under 100 people have died from mass shootings.  So if you do the math, 7 x more people in Chicago have died from HAND gun violence than from mass shootings and this is just ONE city in the US.  If it was about keeping people safe, the Left would go after hand guns, not ""assault"" weapons."

That is why his  actions are HOLLOW and DISGRACEFUL. As a vet, I hope he burns in the hell he associates with. 

As a disclaimer. I understand and agree with parents choice in not mandating their kids reciting the pledge. I did, but we can agree they are children and it is beyond them at school age.

To Bannon (and to most of the people around Trump for that matter), Trump is merely a useful idiot, a means to their ends.

Individual testing, used to support learning, are called quizzes and tests. Statewide competition among schools is a stupid way to assess anything, sorry. It's only expensive and was designed to carry forward the narrative of failing schools. If we are doing a good job then test scores should fluctuate around a mean, based on natural variation...they should be flat over years. Unless we become all sciencecall the time in which case science scores will rise, for awhile, and then flatten, and then drop because this form of teaching sucks the life out of learning. And in truth we test the wrong things for schools and teachers...life long interest, problem solving, human relationship skills, being in touch with an academic future, are the measure of success, not tests scores.

These finding could also be used to dramatically change the face of Industrial Agriculture, but that will never happen because of this obsession with corporate greed through obscene profit making.

Shouldn't he be on your list of unprotected goalies.  I agree with your assessment that Bobby Ryan is left unprotected, despite his great play during Cup playoffs, he is the most expensive player in the lineup and plenty of other forwards to protect. In short Ottawa because it is an up and coming team and developed its players through its farm system and not through the draft lottery, stands to lose the most.

This is not such a big change here in WA State, where State law requires that tipped employees make minimum wage, but in the rest of the country, where tipped employees get paid much less than half the Federal minimum, it is a radical transformation. 

The menu prices at Jig & Lure included tax and tip, and the menu told you so.  The business with local charities started because people were still leaving tips  --  at the end of each month, the tips would then be given to a charity of the employees' choosing.

Most thought it would be a cakewalk and thus campaigned poorly.  That is common for parties with big leads in the polls to get complacent think Dix in BC in 2013, Peterson in Ontario in 1990 as examples.  Also what constituencies both sides will target will change as Labour will go after some traditionally safe Tory seats they came close in, but the Tories will probably focus more on the seats they lost and others they came close in then going after longshots as they campaigned a lot in Labour held ridings they failed in.  A lot of the ridings they lost, they weren't expecting to lose so will put more resources into those as they largely ignored them this past election."

The ARP has been in disarray since Palin came on the scene and the AO-37 debacle demonstrated that the only organized power in the State other  than oil is organized labor.   Oil will only play on things that go directly to their interests, so that leaves most State issues in organized labor's hands.   Vince isn't waiting to see who gets elected; he's waiting to see if he can become President of the Senate, and if he doesn't get his coalition majority, of course he'll caucus with his long-time union buddies in the Democrat caucus.   Saw this coming a year ago, but somebody in Beltrami's position taking the point is unprecedented.   Nobody in labor has ventured above Commissioner of Labor before."

IF (a big if) people increase discretionary spending proportionate to the wage increase, there MAY be some volume savings (but only in certain industries).  Otherwise a reduction in employment levels is virtually assured."

Come on now Andrew, if you truly ""denounce the payment""  you should have urged Mr. Trudeau not to pay Mr Khadr and give the money instead  to Tabatha Scheer directly. 

Then have the strength of your convictions to explain to your newly found populist supporters why you support the Canadian Government giving taxpayers' money to Americans!

Trump admits he was a troublemaker at primary school. ‘I liked to stir things up and I liked to test people,’ he said years later. ‘It wasn’t malicious so much as it was aggressive.’ Trump bragged for a long time that, aged eight, he almost got expelled for giving his music teacher a black eye ‘because I didn’t think he knew anything about music’. The teacher, Charles Walker, remembered Trump as supremely attention-seeking.

Some were conquering, some built massive structures and large infrastructure works , others were nomadic. Many affected their environment and controlled it, changing local climates, deforestation, etc others did not. Most adapted to new technologies, whether horses or guns, etc, and modified their societies accordingly. Sadly, what they couldn't fight was germs and diseas, which wiped 90% of them out.

27834,"Thank you for an excellent column. I would, however, like to add a further perspective. In Canada, tax money has followed the child since the Quebec Act of 1774. In Alberta, for example, tax money follows students to Catholic, private, and other sectarian (e.g., Dutch Reformed) schools, as well to district-run and charter public schools.  Students in all of these schools must meet provincial standards, which are assessed in 3rd (optional), 6th and 9th grade (the Province's highest level assessment is PISA). There is an integrated provincial curriculum, along with student, parent, and teacher guides. Schools have the option not to use them. But every year, every school's value-added results (achievement growth above what student demographics would predict) is widely published, and most parents use to make their school choices. So what people here in the US call a ""voucher"" system can, in fact, work well. But multiple design factors are critical to its success."

Over the years I watched as time and time again, this same 'type' of priest was exposed as an abuser. The love of 'the collar' - except in the dock in court! - and all the trappings of clericalism, harsh judgement of the perceived failings of others, lack of empathy, hatred of Vat II, Latinate, obsession with Mary, the whole package.

You can imagine then as we watched JPII and Benedict promoting such scoundrels how we felt. I'll never forget watching a group of young clerics punching the air in St Peters Square as Ratzinger emerged dressed in white. It was stomach churning.

And finally, that journey means that if successful, the dialog will ultimately land m someplace different from where I am when I start.  To me, ALL of those elements must be present, tacitly agreed upon, before a real dialog can and will start.

This is why dialog with church leaders was virtually impossible before Vatican II.  This is why Vatican II meant to much to me, as it seemed to suggest a willingness by church leaders to enter a dialog, real and ongoing, with the laity.

NATO will be fine, but any country not pulling their weight will be told AND rightly so! Canada included! apparently according to the Globe, the Canadian economy if larger than Russia's....so why is our military so puny in comparison?

Trump is exactly what the USA needs, a president that can spot BS, point out the BS and Shovel the BS over to another country.

We want cities who refuse to help the feds capture criminals stripped of as much federal money as possible . You don't reward people who help hide bank robbers so why in the heck reward cities that want to hide criminals ?  And anyone who is here illegally is a criminal by breaking our immigration law.

Totalitarian-collectivism (communism) and it's attendant socialist economic system, is the goal of the Democrats in all their varied forms. Is the Left proudly supporting the Constitution and the American system defined by such? 

Does the Left stand for the very basis of Americanism, *individual* rightful liberty and unalienable human rights endowed on us by our Creator?

Has Trump ever fixed the screening system that he said needed to be fixed as an excuse for his ""90 day"" suspension of acceptance of people from those dangerous countries on his list? I note that Uzbekistan was not one of them.

However, there were government emails as she was the Sec. of State at the time. I don't know what was in the emails but those are all government property and are required to be returned upon leaving office. Instead they were deleted. Another question is whether her servers were hacked and someone else has the documents. These could affect or threaten people's lives.

The credibility of Canadian business commenting on public finance must be looked at with great scepticism when one looks at the investment decisions they have made over the last decade and their lack of action on employment and wages. 
Trudeau is an idiot if he thinks privatizing infrastructure to this crowd will help the Canadian economy.  They would sooner sell us downriver for a quick buck then invest in our communities.  Look at realtors in Vancouver and Toronto - quick buck from foreigners trumps young Canadians getting a home."

Rather, his contention is that the conduct of the government of Canada in connection with his detention by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay, and in particular Canada’s collaboration with the U.S. government in 2003 and 2004, violated his rights under the Charter , and requires as a remedy that the government now request his return to Canada.

I like that he doesn't pander to the rest of the world who has sucked off of our teet, used our resources, and gotten us in to supremely stupid agreements, fiscally and otherwise.

 You act like the last 5 presidential elections is a great number and only 2 terms is way lower than it should be. It only means that 2 times out of 5 the electoral college went the other way, not really a significant number since in the case of Bush vs Gore it was only a half million votes.

Many Hawaiians attended Punahou from the start and still do today.  I am no fan of Punahou but fair is fair.  I note that many living out here still are ignorant about the real history of the state.  Incidentally, missionary teachers and their Hawaiian teacher colleagues taught in Hawaiian and English in hundreds of public schools in the 1820's and 1830's.  Missionaries preserved the Hawaiian language, translated it, transliterated it, taught it and worked with Hawaian roayalty to honor it as an official language of the kingdom.

The fact of the matter is that the legislature should fund a special appropriation to properly man the crime lab with the high quality forensic specialist necessary to perform the tasks expected of the lab. They should also provide funds to properly compensate the crime lab supervisor as it is a very highly specialized function. I suspect currently Alaska is not able to offer wages that are competitive in order to draw the very best people to work at the lab.

Additionally, people don't seem to realize that often the lab specialists are away from the lab testifying in court, or waiting to testify in court, which of course slows down the process even more. And much of the equipment used at the lab is outdated. The lab should be a shining star in forensics but lacks proper funding."

I don't expect that is how things are going to turn out if the investigations occur under the current leadership.  Democrats will likely (fairly or unfairly) call on Republicans who chair the intelligence committees to release more or different information.  Investigations will almost definitely get hampered by political ploys as a result of Republican leadership in the House and Senate refusing to set up special bi-partisan investigations to pull the teeth from that concern in the first place.  I'm just waiting for the Republicans to try and make that into a wedge issue that they are entirely responsible for enabling."

No one who visits this type of clinic is that acute as either the person is unconscious or in so much pain they will go directly to the ER.   Agree all the docs are top notch & have experience, however with this type of clinic you cannot choose the same doc who has seen you previously & that can cause a lot of wasted time & effort vs. seeing the same doctor who is most familiar with your case.

As with mercy, it may often require harsh words and condemnation of those we love for failing to adhere strictly to the teachings of the church.

29854,"Part 2

I made a short visit home a couple of weekends ago, and my parents took me to a performance of Bach's St. John Passion with the Cleveland Orchestra.  Outstanding.  I was far more familiar with the St. Matthew Passion also by Bach, and I love that work as well, but I think I have found a new favorite.  It was an outstanding addition to my Lent observances.  Try and listen to both if you can.  The St. John has two final chorus numbers that were so amazingly impressive: the one is a sort of ""lullaby"" to Jesus, that He rest in peace and without pain now, and that we will no longer prevail upon him to do for us.  How overwhelmingly sad.  The last chorus is a prayer, that when God's angels wake us from our own lifeless sleep on the day of judgment, that we will open our eyes to see the face of the Redeemer, and we will sing His praises forever.  Bach perfectly sums up the central Christian belief in this.  And so I leave you to contemplate them as well.  Blessings to you all."

She should not have taken the bait on partial birth abortion in the debates, since it is already banned under federal law.  She should have used this opportunity to show that Trump was as much of an ignorant panderer as Sarah Palin was when she could not describe what she disliked about Roe and then she should have attacked the pro-life movement as an organ of GOP politics and that people should not be fooled, even if some of the Catholic bishops cooperate with their little game.  Could she have won?  Maybe.  She certainly could not have lost any worse in PA, MI, OH, WI.  She could have also said that when the two W. appointees were given the chance to overturn Roe, they did not do so.

This also applies the use of deadly force in self-defense for those without such grants of authority.  Those who commit homicide in self-defense are still guilty of breaking the law but are not blamed because society and government excuses them for committing homicide in those circumstances.

http://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/new-doj-statistics-on-race-and-violent-crime/

This table can be used for a number of interesting calculations. First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.

Interestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time."

Perhaps the ROK admin will make their own accommodation with China. As such, the US may have to destroy the threat to the US from the North without South Koreans support since the threat of a nuclear attack on the US is secondary in ROK eyes to saving South Korea from a DPRK attack.

In fact, the president who initiated the largest fine you cited in your argument in US Dept of Justice history was initiated by president Bush in 2006 against Mr. Sterling and had nothing to do with Sterlings racist comments caught in tape about his wife's association with African American players on the Clippers team that president Obama expressed his opinion on. The $2.725m judgement in 2009 was instead a result of systemic, intentional and serial discrimination incidents by Sterling on non white tenants and applicants.  Now Bill.  Its time to fess up.  It ain't the courts and judges, dude.  They are there to protect us against ideologues who want the rest of us to look at everything through their own ideological lenses.

Notice there are no females dressing as males competing as males. They would also not be welcome on a guys team. So since this transgender issue will likely favor only guys being girls it will come out unequal. And until you menstruate and have cramps you are not a real woman. I would like to hear from girls dressing as boys and see if they feel equal amongst the boys.  I personally feel robbed as a female letting males impersonate females.

Especially when it is followed up with a hit list of other natives he would have liked less.  Adding that he was there to proselytize and his commercial interests were secondary would not be a ringing endorsement, even if it were true.  

It's odd that the only merit you seem to find in Columbus is that he was Italian.  As a nation of immigrants we often identify more with our countries of ancestry than we do with our country of birth.  So much so that Italian-Americans lobbied Congress to create a holiday in 1934.  Rather than note how many Presidents had good things to say about the holiday, Ms. Allen should have observed that it was created as an act of political appeasement.   For most Americans, Columbus Day is not family and parades, it's just construction paper ships and a day without mail."

The fact is that the Filipinos fought in the Philippines against an invasion by Imperial Japan.  They fought to protect their homeland, which is admirable.

To reduce their sacrifices to ""fighting for America"" is inaccurate and condescending, and projects a colonial mentality.

Japan had been rampaging across China for years as it pursued imperialist expansion and raw materials to feed its war machine.  The Philippines was a very weak American commonwealth that was on the verge of independence when Japan invaded.

Maybe we should consider awarding gold medals to everyone who fought in the Philippines, including the Americans.  It wasn't even their home.

The truth is that the Gold Medals are being considered as a political accommodation in lieu of veterans benefits that were rescinded upon Philippine independence.

The fundamental ethos of the United States is utterly different.   One of the strongest ideas is that anyone could go from rags to riches and they could do it through their own hard work and ingenuity.   Individualism is paramount, even if social mobility has declined, which is has over the past few decades.

Canada is different yet again, however, we're not as community-minded as either the Swedes or the Japanese.   A lot of Canadians identify with being community-aware, but individualism is also strong here compared to a lot of places.   All one has to do is read a lot of the comments on these boards to know that's the case."

I do not agree with the line of argument that we shouldn't complain about this or that government program because it only costs the individual taxpayer a small amount such as ""pennies per year"" or ""a few dollars per year"". The problem with this argument is that there are tens of thousands of programs like this - and the total cost adds up to the largest single expense that every taxpaying citizen faces. So if we can't cut any individual program because it only costs a few cents a year per taxpayer, then that basically means we can't cut anything ever.

You are right IMO that Andrew gave a crackerjack speech on Friday especially in his attacks on The Clown Prince.

Probably Scheer will get even better sharpening his attacks on Trudeau  and this is vital to success in 2019 since the media will mostly continue to give Justin a free pass and since the popularity of the Liberal government is pretty much all Trudeau and his celebrity.

A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.

Assuming voters decide they want change and conclude the PM has failed to meet expectations, a strong campaign by Scheer will bring victory.

14319,"I think you view the Church's perspective as referring to homosexuals and not their acts is because homosexuals define themselves by the acts that they engage in; there is no separation between the act and the person.

I have sex with my wife, yes, for self-gratification.  But I married my wife to have children and form a family, not to have a sex partner.  I suppose there is some bonding element to the act, seeing that is how our children were conceived, but we do not engage in sodomy of any sort even though that would feel good.  She is disgusted by the thought of it, and I am quite satisfied with using my body the way it is clearly intended to be used.

I think that God (or evolution, for the secularists) has made it pretty clear that we're not supposed to use our sex organs for recreation.  We need only look at the sexual ills of our society (STDs, adultery, porn, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, pedophilia, gay bathhouses, prostitution, etc....) to see what is right and intended"

Spur did handle things badly by effectively attributing the problem solely to the man, particularly by banning him and his family. Farrelly, that's perhaps you as Corporate?

That the border must be secure to ensure that terrorist do not enter. (Anybody object to that?)

The young people I know who have left the church haven't done so over theological issues.

Of course, if progressives on this issue think anti-W.O. sentiment in Silver Springs is an important enough issue to leave the Church, they probably shouldn't be too surprised if their kids use that issue as an excuse for leaving.

By comparison, Dover Straits carries 25% of world seaborne trade: 600 commercial vessels in transit or crossing daily.  The Strait of Malacca, approximately 500 nautical miles long, between the coastlines of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore sees annual traffic of 64,000 ships; 21,000 container ships & 23,000 tankers.

4788,"Woman was merely man's helpmate, a function which pertains to her alone. She is not the image of God but as far as man is concerned, he is by himself the image of God. 

--St. Augustine

As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of woman comes from a defect in the active force or from some material indisposition, or even from some external influence.

--St. Aquinas

Another kind [of prophesying] is specific to priests, and is not suitable for women, for it is the role of women to be subservient, not to be dominant. And it is this reason that blessed Paul adduces (in 1 Corinth.14): “Let women be silent in the Church, for they are not permitted to speak, but they must be subject...” .’

They said this while praising, and asking God's blessing, on JPII, Ratzinger, Sodano and Bertone. These four men - with their allies - have absolutely trashed our Church. JPII DID know about Maciel and sexual/drug taking allegations against him since day one of his Papacy. Bertone helped himself to Peter Pence money, sacked the guy who was heading the investigation into the Vatican bank, surrounded himself with corrupt clerics, built himself a palace. Sodano supported every murderous regime in South America. They allowed powerful groups of clergymen to overrun the Vatican, connected through homosexual parties or through seeking power.

The process is complex and very inefficient and may actually be at the same level or less ( ~ 35% efficient) as the ICE process.  In a world of increasingly scarce and more expensive energy, hydrogen would not seem to be suitable for anything more than some niche applications .  

EV ranges of 350+ km and recharge times of < 30 minutes would seem to make hydrogen largely redundant.

29899,"I too had to wait quite a while to get into the system. But once in, I have not experienced unusually long wait times for appointments. And the VA does have an ER at the Denver facility ... if a patient does not have an immediate life threatening situation, there may be wait times of an hour or more but that can be true of any ER.

For example: Earlier this year I made an appointment to check a pain I had in my leg. I called the Golden clinic and got in to see a doc in a few days. While there he thought I should have an ultra sound, but there was no ultra sound equipment at the Golden clinic. So the doc called the Denver hospital and told them I was coming in  right away. About an hour later the ultra sound had been completed in the Denver VA, and I was on my way home. The whole thing cost me a $50 co-pay. Even with Medicare, an ultra sound in a private hospital might cost 10 times that much and probably couldn't be done any faster.

Granted, this was Denver. Can't speak for elsewhere."

29832,"I think Sinnott's findings hold up. We all know bears and other wildlife will use trails to travel, especially when they're relatively empty most of the time. Cyclists are more likely to approach at a higher speed, and perhaps more quietly than a hiker, giving the bear and the cyclist less reaction time to deal with the other's sudden presence.

That said, it's a risk we all take when we go out here in Alaska. Even in town in parks like Kincaid or Far North Bicentennial Park (FNBP), we know there are animals out there, and some of those are bear. Taking basic precautions like knowing the trails, listening to other riders about who's seen bear tracks, scat etc where, and carrying bear spray.

I rode FNBP for years with my father, an avid cyclist. He talked with other riders and knew when to avoid certain trails like Rover's Run. I never encountered a bear riding, but we had spray if we needed it. Basic precautions like Sinnott says DO WORK."

The quotation bears a much closer resemblance to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s comment in his famous letter from Birmingham Jail: ""One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.""

Regarding Hillary and Donald, both reprehensible people, both liars, both at least in part psychopathic personalities, though their respective administrations would have differing impacts on our nation.

2. The CIA did not protect their most important spyware.  It did not ""classify"" that spyware.  (The CIA did not want to breach government rules for using ""classified"" documents and processes, so the spy tools were not classified.)  That means that the hacker community could also use those tools.  In fact, the government often employs hackers to develop its tools.  So there is a high probability that some of those tools have already been copied by hackers.  In fact, employees of the U.S. government itself have been increasingly charged with collecting information for unauthorized purposes."

There are not many places where the main line still has people throwing switches by hand, just like the 1860's.

I am a rail romantic, have done the Trans Siberian, coast to coast in the USA, the Ghan in Australia, coast to coast in Panama, and bits in Suriname, South Africa, UK, I stop for railroad museums.  However, there has to be a cost-benefit ratio for someone to keep a railroad going.  If a legislature, board of directors, or  someone can't find it, the plug is pulled."

1. The Liberals prioritized Corporate interests, while it's common knowledge that small businesses are the real economic driver.
2. Governments are not the be all and end all of economic activity.  ""Liberal-generated surplus""?  Let's drop that illusion.  
3. The Liberals prided themselves as ""the people in the business suits"", yet were way off in their forecast.  How does this qualify them as having been competent managers - especially as the pronounced miss was on the 'positive' side?
4. A surplus pales when racking up all-time-high debt, and seeing highest poverty levels in Canada.  
Liberal pundits are guilty of 'heads I win, tails you lose' logic here.  If the economy 'grows', that's the former government's credit.  If it doesn't, that's the NDP's fault.  No matter WHAT the NDP now do, they will fail based on this logic.  Ridiculous."

Bill denied any knowledge to Congress but the CIA rewarded him with a trip to the White House. (they don't forget their friends).  Clintons brother served federal time for coke running and many people with intimate knowledge of the Clintons drug use and coke selling ended up dead over the years, including Vince Foster who threatened to blow the lid off this and other stories and paid the price.

I can certainly accept that LSUC may establish rules for its membership, just as TWU does. For example, LSUC could state explicitly that their members must offer professional services to anyone regardless of the sexual orientation. Voila! Problem solved, no?

Dukes does not believe this issue is funny.

Dukes belongs to the same Black Liberation Faith group lead by Jeremiah Wright, Obama's pal.  Wright said Pearl Harbor was a lie and that he hated both America and whites.  Obama never disowned Wright;  naturally, the lying progressive MSM gave the racist Obama and his racist pastor a pass.  Black racism is perfectly acceptable to the globalist MSM.

I agree that some Chinese living in Canada might be innocent, but you have to assume that some accused of corruption or fraud are ACTUAL criminals. They defraud people in China, escape to Canada, and then defraud actual Canadians. The victims of extradition aren't even Canadian...

Obviously the chance of a Chinese criminal committing the same crime in Canada is small. But an extradition treaty does NOTHING that would hurt real Canadians. Yet, it prevents Canada from becoming a haven for Chinese criminals that might commit the same crimes against Canadians... if Canada gets more favorable trade terms with China out of this, its a Win-win IMO.

The value to their education in being in a somewhat normalized setting is high, and so is the value to mainstream students being around others different than them.

At the same time, Bannon was concerned that the United States and the “Judeo-Christian West” were in a war against an expansionist Islamic ideology — but that they were losing the war by not recognizing what it was. Bannon said this fight was so important, it was worth overlooking differences and rivalries with countries like Russia.>>

That's the dilemna.  Hydro-Quebec planned ahead 40 years ago and updated infrastructure.

I'm extremely concerned about US foreign policy; I thought RCism was in best position to be a counterweight to the real threats to Christianity (as well as Muslims) but too many RCs remain willfully blind to the real threats, out of a combo of ignorance, cowardice, laziness, and more understandable fact that they've been lied to for most of their lives.

""Successful implementation of the first round of National Determined Commitments under the Paris agreement is a large step towards the objective of limiting global warming to 3.6°F (2°C). Even greater greenhouse gas emission reductions are required beyond 2030 in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the 2°C goal"""

Only the public workers can retire with all their salaries. Up to 33k/month (there are higher ones).
The majority of the population starve with a meager 1k/month which barely pays a rent in a big city.

The best solution is to cut the benefits of retiring with their whole salary for public sector employees, and to remove their benefit of retiring with only 30 years of labor, unlike the rest of the population that needs 40 years to retire."

It would be wonderful to see a politician with the courage to do so. It would be beautiful to see him publicly ask forgiveness of all who he has belittled and scorned.

19548,"I've read elsewhere that ADHD has numerous causes.  Some kids diagnosed are simply overactive kids in the classroom (usually boys) who are restless sitting still. Some kids have so little exercise that they're too jumpy to sit still (also usually boys).  Some are eating such bad food and so much sugar in juices and pops, that they're hyper.  And finally, there is probably the few (not 1 in 20) who actually have a serious problem.

All of this is treated with medication instead of probing for deeper causes. Now these kids, in addition to Ritalin are being prescribed anti-psychotics!  Sensibly this article at one point states that perhaps these kids should go and run around... but the concluding statement is like a shrug saying, what the heck, pills are easier.

- There is nothing ""crude"" about bringing children into this world and raising them. 
- Biology is what it is so don't denigrate the 50% of us who don't get pregnant.
- As for house hold chores and ""working"" - do realize that in the good old days keeping house ( in its full sense ) was a full time job, including a garden, making clothes, cleaning and laundry without the efficiency of modern appliances ( vacuum cleaner, fridge/freezer,   prepared groceries, ready made clothing .... ). Never mind the support of modern medicine. An argument may be made that modern women in fact work less overall than ever before.

The video clearly shows that the individual had his hands up but walking away from the police. His hands were clearly down as he was shot reaching for something inside his car. Actually I was bit surprise how clear the real video was compared to what I have seen on your major news media. Finally, according to other news sources, the individual had a lengthy criminal record, mostly dealing with drug uses. (First time you heard that I bet!!)  That will appeared on any police computer (just asked APD).  So there was just cause to the police behavior. Usually, lengthy criminal record rises the major red flag and forces police officers in a high alert stage. I guess that is a penalty for being an ex-convict several times over.

That priesthood, in its fullness in the bishops, holds true authority as Christ founded a hierarchical Church.

It has nothing to do with knowledge, experience or job performance of coaches in the athletic field.   You simply can't warm up a team properly in heels and a dress/skirt.  Also, she is in compliance with her contract via Under Armour.   Coach Robyn is a wonderful choice to inherit this legendary program, and taking into account all that she's had to endure, she's doing a great job in her rookie year!

And, how do you feel about the management of Trump hotels (and their employees) if the the national anthem is not played to begin each shift of work, and if it is, many employees don't show up?  I mean, how could Trump POSSIBLY not have been requiring all HIS employees to show up prior to each shift to stand for the national anthem?  Right?"
22953,"Professional organizations have overt ways to restrict the supply. Whether they are onerous certification exams for immigrants or restricting the number of students in universities. 

For example, a would be veterinarian must go to the vet college for their province. They can not go to any other Canadian vet college. In Ontario that this is the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) in Guelph. They only take 110 students although demand is 400+. In many other programs the university would simply add capacity or other universities, seeing an opportunity, would develop their own programs. But the OVC is controlled by the association so it keeps the enrollment low. You can attend a foreign vet school but at $200k+ it is prohibitive.

Med school enrollment is also restricted. My friends have had to send their daughter to Australia for medical school even though she had the grades."

The argument that government is a separate (and bad) thing has become chillingly common, particularly on the right end of the political spectrum. The slow-but-steady erosion of public trust in our government occurs because billions have been spent by private commercial interests in messaging, the same interests who don't want government to work, who want ""freedom"" from what should always be the overriding public interest.

Looking at the abysmal stat line of Denver's 7th pick M&Ms (combined 5 for 14 and 4 assists) I'd say the Nuggets should just make Jokic the point guard (8 assists). It is a good time to be a big white stiff when you can get paid $42 million to play 16 minutes with a minus 14 point differential when you are on the floor. Heck, Greg Kite posted better numbers than that. If the Nuggets had to pay Gary Harris $82 million how much is Will Barton going to cost? Max deal? Not that they can pay him anyway since they are already over the Cap and will have to sign Jokic and one of the M&Ms next year. But hey, the $30 million man got 19 points.

This is not an easy to listen to speech. What is important though is that it was 1989, and how little has changed. So for that alone... listen all the way through.

After all, the reader doesn't know what sources the writer has carefully not used.

I am also reminded of a comment that I have heard in many forms over the years - if everything is an urgent, level one, top priority emergency, then nothing is.

Assuming your figure of $100M/yr in revenue, how much of that will be net profit which will be taxable when run by a private corporation?  Are we going to be faced with government bailout for failed corporations running essential public services?

3. I'm not sure how relevant global competition is for an asset like an airport, which services a fixed geographic location.

Conveniently cities with similarly diverse and vibrant cores to Toronto or Vancouver, but lacking greenbelts have been left out of the analysis (New York, Boston). Is it because they are also very expensive? Maybe truly successful cities are desirable regardless of containment?

26639,"The ""Aloha"" Stadium staff has an adversarial mentality and therefore posture.  Some are off duty or special duty cops, so I understand where that comes from.  But, most aren't law enforcement.  They just wannabe, or think they actually are, or worse, have been instructed and programmed to behave as such.
The truly ironic thing is that the law enforcement on duty at the Stadium all are fairly even handed, and exercises appropriate restraint and good judgment.  It's the staff that often goes too far, inflames situations, acts arbitrary and bullying, and causes a sense of discomfort for victims and bystanders.
Some of that is what they're told to do.  Search bags and confiscate food or drinks.  Do the strip search thing for who knows why.  
.But, they own their demeanors while doing it.

For example, if you're late to work because you made a big poop, you tell your boss ""I wasn't feeling well"" or if he's a cool boss, tell him the truth and laugh about it. On the other hand, if you're late to work because you were committing murder, that's when you tell a wild story about how the queen of Egypt is in town and a band of ninjas swooped down from the sky onto her convoy and stopped traffic for miles.

And even recently, while equalization payments went to the Government of Ontario, _Ontarians_ continued to be net contributors to federal revenues.

They are too ignorant and bigoted to follow the money. Most of the Trump voters think the poor and minorities get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. They are incapable of putting a price tag on poisoning the children of Flint. I would pity them if they didn't think killing minorities would solve their problems.

There are also government aligned Gupta-style oligarchs that embezzle much of the national income. They reject the migrant-quotas forced by the EU  of unskilled and aggressive migrants.  These countries have national traditions and culture often more than a thousand years old and they are not willing to be molded into an impersonal mass-Europe.

Maybe not all the members of HPD, police and civilians alike, may be guilty of criminal acts, but the acquiescence with the knowledge that HPD had a lot of bad officers from top brass to beat officers had committed crimes taints everyone who works at HPD.

Like any organization, covering up becomes a part of the system and the results in the public unable and unwilling to trust their own police force.  Corruption permeates the organization and everyone thinks that bad behavior can be overlooked so long as the SHOPO contract hides those who are caught doing something bad.  Adding to that, the Police Commission being a rubber stamp of the management and not demanding any kind of accountability is a total dereliction of their duty as commissioners.  Mayor Caldwell is just as culpable for failing to demand the Police Commission be accountable for all these problems.  Instead of replacing the commissioners who did nothing, Kirk dodged responsibility."

The result was the Chetco Bar Fire which destroyed numerous homes and thousands of acres of private property, and further enlarged the fire scar and will also enlarge the area that is not safe to suppress fire due to snags from unsalvaged fire kill. 
The statement that the sale of fire salvage will suppress private log prices truly shows Ernie’s disconnect from reality,  since there is a significant shortage of logs available from either private or public and numerous mills are on the edge of curtailing operations due to lack of supply. 
I once had the privilege of listening to Ernie speak in person and true to color he attempted to pass off personal misinformation as fact simply because he is an economist..... oh and it must be true because he comes from a family of loggers.

22233,"I do believe Hawaii's high rate of student bullying stem from the ongoing political issue of the U.S. Federal Government; the stance-contention of an illegal government foisted on the Kanaka people. Their resentment of the Federal government spills over to descendants of the missionary and provisional families - the imported migrant worker descendants - the newly arrived malihini white or haole - the migrating Micronesians! Their resentment is from being displaced in land - employment opportunities - housing availability - language-cultural displacement...seeing the non-kanaka better off or using-taking resources away from the host kanaka culture. There is little appreciation of any advancements-developments that has taken place since the 1900's for the enforced change wrought upon their islands, putting the kanaka people at a disadvantage in their own archipelago country. Their resentment is expressed daily through the synergistic-psychological transference to the viewed outsider."

As for this Trump/Romney romance, the first thing that came to mind was that Mr. Trump was toying with Mr. Romney, as a cat might toy with a mouse before putting it out of its misery. I still think it's the most logical explanation, as Romney would be a total outlier to the rest of the cabinet. And I do believe that Mr. Trump relishes getting even.

Under the new legislation, as long as the ASD is in the possession of the officer, that dispenses with the grounds. The gov't is going to argue that that is ok because it's ""minimally intrusive."" The existing caselaw says that your Charter rights are suspended if the demand is made forthwith, compliance can be had forthwith, and there is grounds (opinion of alcohol in the body). That all has to happen pretty much at once. Your charter rights are still breached, but the breach is saved by s. 1 because it's minimally intrusive.

It might be worthwhile to get to know them and their values and work with them to develop even more their values that already are gospel values. IMHO the focus needs to be on how to live the gospel here and now. The purpose of the requirement to ""go to mass"" on Sundays originally was to keep folks in contact with a believing and praying community that shares their values. These days many folks already have such communities without labelling them as such.

I believe Jesus meant it when he promised to send the Holy Spirit to teach us to ""observe everything I have commanded you"". Much of what ""diehard"" (and I use the term respectfully) want to enforce and impose has nothig to do with what Jesus commanded his followers, but focuses on control by a few, keeping folks in line, and the good order of the church."

Damn.  Are we stuck with this font?  Never mind.

Elizabeth Renzetti's article is a very good one.  It argues for allowing opinion, even on a hot topic.   (Especially on a hot topic, I'd say.)  ""Cultural appropriation: Why can't we debate it?"" she asks.  Well, the 253 comments before this one have been doing exactly that, so I guess that's her question answered.  But is anybody in this thread going to lose their job because of the views expressed here?  Not if their name is Retrofit, apparently.  So, why are people losing their jobs over this?  Because a smallish group of angry people disagree with their opinion?  Were Niedzvieki, Kay and Ladurantaye guilty of hate speech?  Is that why they lost their jobs?  No?  Then why did they lose their jobs over being part of a debate?  I support Renzetti's take on this.

Future Church, AUSCP (Assoc of US Catholic Priests), Voice of the Faithful are supporting this push for women deacons ONLY, in order to hopefully get the laity's support for optional celibacy for male priests.  This trade off can only result in complete gender segregation of our church's governing and sacramental authority, where all men will have all power, voice, and control over all the women of the church.  Do not be fooled by these groups they are largely containing of ex-priests who have married and many deacons who want ordination only for men.  

If you want to support real equality in our church, that can only come thru equal ordination, starting with priesthood because priesthood is the initial step to all the other levels of sacramental and governmental authority.

Condos are basically a capitalist version of those horrible Soviet apartment blocks that are a watch word for public squalor (people urinating in the elevators, bad behavior, etc.).

You say ""dogs should be allowed to be dogs"", and then list what that means to you. Common civility requires me to listen and understand your opinion, I don't have to agree with it. If your dog (or, as you refer to it, your family member) runs free, don't you have the responsibility to train that ""family member"" to stay on the trail? Or leash the dog?  Would you let your dog run in traffic & then get upset with the driver who hits the dog?  How, in your mind, are those situations different?  

Your judgement of the situation is what dictates safe practices.  Trapping happens.  Knowing that, I'd think you'd curtail your desire for it to ""run free"" if you truly love the dog.

They do not name their sources for obvious reasons, nor they did not name the city mentioned by Trump as the locus for bomb design or that Israel  was the information source.  

There is usually nothing the press would like more than to prove a competitor wrong.   When various but divergent sources converge, the information is likely to be credible and actionable. When a story comes from one source and is parroted and echoed, it isn't.

Recently, I heard a guy (that works at a new car dealership down here in the U.S.) say that he estimates based on his experience only about 5% of Americans are buying brand new cars. And with the average new vehicle price being north of $30,000 USD who would dispute that assessment? The 'regular' folks that do buy new are taking out 7-8 year loans to do it, which is outrageous. 

I buy used. Several years ago, I bought my current vehicle 1 year old and saved $8,000. This Fall, I plan to buy a fully loaded 2 year old Mazda6 for $20,000 (brand new price = $35,000).

They used to enjoy 6400 fans and sell outs .  People flat out don't care anymore.  If so many cared about the U of A sports they would speak out against cutting them.  Instead , they are speaking out against them.  On top of that the UAA athletic director must want hockey cut----why else would he show home games on TV allowing cheap skates and the lazy to not attend hurting the bottom line ? Again I ask , if UAA students don't support their own sports teams , why should anyone else ?"

On a day when ENB shares rise in price, you'll say things like ""the stock is being manipulated"" or ""there's some kind fraudulent-like or Ponzi-like activity going on to push the share price up."" 

So when the stock falls, all is right with the world. And when it rises, it has to be somekindof scam. 

If something occurs that is in line with your thinking, all is right with the world. (gold, C$, interest rates). If the opposite to what you want to see happen does happen, then something isn't right and someone is doing something to cause this, whether it is Ponzi, manipulation, the government or extraterrestrials.

The true cost per 911 call is a lot lower than $35. Who pays the extra cost? The normal law abiding person probably pays more than the violator. The minimum fine should be $60.

While it would be nice to think he has read, or will in the future read, Laudato Si, reports have weighed heavily against his ability or desire to read anything longer than a 140-character Tweet or hand-held complimentary poster.  Even daily security briefs have been heavily summarized to accommodate his limited attention span.  He doesn't appear to operate within the realm of rationality or reality beyond his own voracious ego."

People of higher intelligence and industry who work hard have always done better than those who are less intelligent and less industrious. It's Economics.

Since people with similar charteristics tend to group together, some countries like Japan, Denmark, Germany and Israel tend to be populated by a somewhat higher proportion of people that have developed these characteristics over time.

There are many studies on what makes a nation prosperous versus what makes a nation poor, and race, religion or the level of foreign aid have nothing to do with it.

If you are prepared to open your mind, I will be happy to cite some of the studies."

24831,I watched the convention results live on CBC and Peter MacKay brilliantly called out the 2 major flaws in the leadership process. 1). The entrance fee to join the race was clearly too low which lead to so many fringe candidates entering with minimal fundraising just to get some spotlight for themselves on a national platform. 2). Every member who sent in a ballot should have been required to rank 10 candidates not just a few. Had every member ranked 10 candidates than the chance for ballot tampering would  have greatly been reduced and every member's ballot would have been considered for each round till the winner was announced.  This also would have prevented special interest groups like those representing pro-life that secured votes for Brad Trost  from having their candidates finish so high despite lacking any consensus support across the membership. These groups instructed their followers only to rank just their candidates and no one else. Some still ranked others but most did not.

And yet a lot of wedlock kids happened with kids who still saw their daddies and were directly supported by them but mom wanted nothing with dad.

He's been divorced twice--that tells you his morals stink--and he lived briefly in Sweden, which tells you he hates America.  Why, I read on Breitbart (soon to be the official White House website!) that over 60% of the regular weekly listeners to Prairie Home Companion were blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, or queers.

Even so, your boss has to treat you well because of unions. Even if you aren't a member of a union, you are still enjoying the benefits of unions. I know that you probably don't have the capacity for considering another viewpoint that doesn't mesh perfectly with your own but, guess what?

(Ironically, she wants to tour Europe, the source of horrible white people.)  I happen to be white but know so many brown people as cousins, friends and fine co-workers that I think I know why there hasn't been an outpouring of denunciations of Pimienta's back-of-the-bus-ism from people ""of colour"".

The major reason, in my opinion, is that, because she has had 30 years of nonstop hostile investigation of her every word, on tape or on paper, she wanted to keep tight control over her correspondence, knowing that it would be presented, out of context, before the public and numerous hostile Congressional committees, and possibly, to a special prosecutor. The second reason is that it followed SecState precedent set by Rice and Powell, the latter of whom actually wrote to HRC recommending she use a private server (though Powell later denied this, the email exists). Powell also refused to hand over emails to a committee, and destroyed emails (that probably were personal business). The Democratic Committee didn't make a big issue of it, if you are in tune to contrasts.

The black people I worked for, with and supervised were men and women who would be offended to have someone think they needed 'affirmative action' or 'special' treatment just because of their skin color.   The first one I met was the son of a New York surgeon who was Jewish because that's the religion of his family when other blacks in Africa captured and sold them to the British.

The same was true of lots of Hispanics, ""NewYoricans"" (their term; not mine) Native Americans, and all kinds of other people who weren't riding the privileged racial status gravy train the civilian world thinks is necessary.

10963,Thank you Chuck! I know that all the truth will come out eventually and the American people will find that they voted a pedophile into office. Not once but several times. There is a big pedophile ring in Washington. Trump and the Clintons have gone to Jeffery Epstein's island several times. Trump has been quoted that he has known Jeffery for 15 years and that he is a terrific guy. There was a case against Trump and Jeffery from a Jane Doe that had witnesses. She dropped her case from getting to many death threats. She was 13 years old when she was raped by Trump. The media never covered this case and if they did it would show how connected and close all these sick people are. I have a feeling Trump is going to try and censor the real news.

21704,"ctnd...

""Patronising?"" On the contrary, I take women's religious beliefs seriously. Women who choose to wear the symbol of the most extreme version of Islam, despite its horrific history and the fact most Muslims see it as extreme, do it because they believe what the most extreme teachings tell them rather than the more moderate version, and they are not making up a new, more modern version.

 I repeat, I am not demanding anyone ""prove their loyalty"", that is your interpretation. I said i would rather know my non -Muslim neighbor is not being refrained from killing me (or raping me, or robbing me, etc.)  because it is against the law, or the Charter, but because he has no desire to, or believes it is morally wrong.

Extremely questionable. GLD makes the claim that it is completely supported by physical gold yet it denies your every day investors the right to exchange for any of their listed 'gold'. This alone means GLD shares are just paper by the day's end. Moreover, GLD's prospectus is loaded with weasel clauses that lets the trust get away without the promised gold backing. A good example of this is in the section of the prospectus that states GLD has no right to audit subcustodial gold possessions. I have never heard of any justifiable reason explaining why this audit loophole exists.

There was also a well documented visit by CNBC's Bob Pisani to GLD's gold vault. This visit was organized by GLD's management to prove the existence of GLD's gold but the gold bar held up by Mr. Pisani had the serial number ZJ6752 which did not appear on the most recent bar list at that time. This ""GLD"" bar was later found to be owned by ETF Securities."

But those tax cuts didn't expand GDP growth, which had stalled along with economic activity.  For that matter, so-called ""stimulative"" tax cuts, sold to us as ""trickle down economics"" - meaning that great wealth granted to the already wealthy would result in a ""trickling"" of wealth down upon the heads of lesser men, women, and their families.

In other words, this is not a man who can move this country in the right (or left) direction except by divisiveness.  It does take someone with some principles other than making money to really lead people in a way in which they learn to get along, to form and respect the idea that we are a community, that we do have to respect each other, find common ground.  I don't get that from tRump.  He acts out of a win/lose paradigm, with nothing in-between - and he will make ""deals"" that let him perceive a win even if they create great harm for others.

And NAFTA's trade deficits have been a target as long as it's been alive.  Trying to artificially correct to a trade surplus will make the price of goods rise, exports drop and the flow of money in and out self corrects.  “A trade which is forced by means of bounties [subsidies] and [protected] monopolies may be, and commonly is, disadvantageous to the country in whose favor it is meant to be established. But that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places, is always advantageous, though not always equally so, to both.” David Hume and Adam Smith are still relative to this debate.  We are maintaining a similar deficit with Canada -- but we aren't proposing gutting our relationship with them. There's multiple schools of thought on jobs created and lost by NAFTA; pugnacious policy won't make that better."

On Jun 30, 2016 the Federal Court of Appeal quashed the approval of Enbridge's  Northern Gateway project after finding Ottawa failed to properly consult the First Nations affected by the pipeline.
 
The Courts effectively killed the Northern Gateway project because the federal government would have had to go back to square one and redo all the 'consultation and BC would have to do an environmental assessment. With the slump in global oil prices, the project became unprofitable before it was started.

Neither Enbridge nor the governments involved chose to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. In other words the project was dead.

The border adjustment tax would violate any number of trade treaties. NAFTA and the WTO spring immediately to mind, but Paul Ryan and his supporters just don't care.

I'd further note that it is absolutely ludicrous to claim that my being born on this land and contributing to Canadian society has no bearing on my rightful claim to this land.  Just because you say ancestry is more important than virtue of birth or contribution, does not make it so. Race based claims to land ownership, in my opinion, are dangerous and destructive to social harmony and cohesion and therefore, should be rejected."

I start my political/News day reading  the headlines in Real Clear Politics, then go from there,  with an open mind and reading diverging sources. I.e. if i read the WSJ on a subject then immediately read the New York Times for the counter opinion. 

But this morning reading about dossiers, opioid crisis, etc, then came to this part “he may even try to save our beautiful monuments”, laughed out loud. Trump always find something both silly and comical to twist the conversation.

Said that, he may have a point after all. I’m one who finds all this monuments brohahua stupid. Countries have past and history.

Beltrami is totally wrong for the job. He’s a bombastic, short-fused, quick-tempered, unreasonable, inflexible, small-handed, hyper-partisan hack who’s out to prove something to himself.

The legislature doesn’t need more of Beltrami’s kind of angry, bitter, and partisan strife.

Our legislature needs more thoughtful, reasonable, tolerant and flexible people who think before they explode with tirades, jeers and threats against anyone who does not agree with them, as Beltrami is wont to do.

He already doesn’t understand the significant conflict of interest between his job and a senate seat.

Same as the other bully Trump, Beltrami already proved that rules don’t apply to him. Like a spoiled brat he refuses to resign as head of the AFL/CIO-a huge conflict of interest that shows Beltrami is not fit to be a public official.

No, but he along with others in the Rockies VERY young rotation have great potential.

I look at this loss as more of a learning experience for Gray and am very excited to see what he and others in the rotation can do in the next few years.

If you look at British history they had one of the most enlightened cultures in history.  They led the whole world in Parliamentary Government, in the industrial revolution, in the sciences.  The indigenous cultures your parents were so proud of were practicing cannibalism and never developed a modern society.

Steve Meyer never establishes that, but what he does establish is the danger of misguided subjectivity in him deciding who and who does not ""deserve"" a firearm.  Instead of going after the illegal dumping- the real problem- he goes after a couple guys out shooting at the trash.  To be clear, while Steve Meyer is free to write about guns and hunting all he wants, the subject of firearms doesn't seem to be the issue here.

People dumped their trash at that spot, instead of bringing it to the proper place. Since Meyer isn't some authority, why doesn't he work to incentivize others to not illegally dump their trash in the first place?  Does it cost to dump those appliances? I'm very skeptical that the exchange in conversation between the men and Meyer happened at all that way; I'm not sure what the correct course of action to take on illegal dumping, but that was clearly not it."

Do you honestly think that the Dallas incident would have happened, if those two black men had not been executed??

If white police officers continue to gun down black people like this, no one will be surprised if more blacks don't decide to retaliate.  This cycle of violence has to end.  

And it was most definitely NOT Black Lives Matter that inspired Johnson to kill.  All other press reports say that he was a follower of the group called the African American Defense League, which is on Facebook.   AADL specifically called for black people to kill white policemen this week.  Look at their Facebook page:

And why anoint his flock in oil before sending them out to anoint others, as described in Mark 6:13: They cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.

The Gnostics believed Jesus's baptism took place, but only as a cleansing ritual, in preparation for receiving holy anointing oil—the true sacrament. As Chris Bennett writes, “The surviving Gnostic descriptions of the effects of the anointing rite make it very clear that the holy oil had intense psychoactive properties that prepared the recipient for entrance into ‘unfading bliss.’

Actually, there is a second question and that is with the shortage of rental units, how much is it going to cost tax-payers to build ""affordable"" rental housing for the middle class?  Wynne is already proposing providing development charge rebate to select projects (just another Liberal kick-back to friends and relatives), providing Ontario land at below cost, special deals on getting projects moving faster because of development regulations and lowering property taxes on rental units (which, of course should have been made mandatory when Mike Harris introduced it)."

However, regular class teachers are ""forced"" to gear their teaching to the needs of the students in the class.  Realistically (and problematically) this usually means teaching at or near the ""lowest common denominator"" of the class.  Ability grouping, which is opposed by many as ""discriminatory"", can address this issue.  However, this means a portion of students will move ""faster and further"" than those in a ""lower"" ability group.

Passed in the early Bush years, they provided huge cut cuts for the super rich, and token cuts to the rest of us, it quietly eliminated the existing budget surplus he inherited, which was starting to actually pay off the debit. Deceasing  Revenue(mostly tax cuts) and increasing Expenses(two wars) = Deficit. Revenue and budget are both equally important to the result.

Sometimes the best intentions do not work out well at all.  One example is parental permission laws.  In your scenario had your parents wanted you to have an abortion you would have had no choice.  I know a young lady in my area whose father was insisting on an abortion, but she did not want it.  My State has no parental permission laws.  The Planned Parenthood clinic her father took her to, insisted she had the right and the legal standing to make the choice to have the child.  Her father was incensed but her decision was respected.  That boy is now 10 years old and grandpa loves him dearly.   Pro choice is just that, pro choice....no matter the choice."
23057,"Funny.  But still missing the point:

1)  The church was wrong about protecting priests.   But how does that imply the church has lost all authority, and should now have an ""anything goes"" policy respect to other areas of priest's actions?

2)  The church was wrong about  protecting priests.   Some bishops were at fault.  No, actually all bishops were at fault, given that no bishops had a policy of forwarding errant priests to law enforcement.  The reason for this was that the pope of the time explicitly did not care about the allegations against priests, and moreover, upholded canon law that forbade clerics from advertising scandal (ie, contacting the police when a priest molested a child).

So the key question:   if the pope himself was as complicit as the worst bishop, who in the Church as the moral authority to punish bishops?"

Moreover, your ""big tariffs"" idea is in no way a guaranteed revenue stream.  It's speculative at  best.  In fact, I promise you that this whole nonsense about making up the trade deficit is a smokescreen.  It simply appeals to populism and the president knows it.  Nonetheless, I still support and I'm happy to help pay for a more secure border, including ""The Wall."""
7571,"Multiculturalism is ok but it needs its limits. If we create a country that ignores uniform constitutional rights and endows or encourages different, uneven rights upon separate groups - religious, ethnic and/or cultural - we will fail as a nation.

Thanks to mixed-feminist/Islamic messages from Trudeau, Muslim women need help in Canada - clearly, they're prisoners in a culture with misogynistic cells, where many masochistically self-impose a lockdown with religious fervour and stubbornly argue with critics that it's their democratic right to do so.

Easy to speak for the few, too bad it imprisons the majority of fearful moderate Muslim women who given the chance just want to blend in with other western women.

How do we know this? Just look at the historical direction of Muslim women in Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and others where gradual relaxations on strict cultural garb inevitably leads to crushing crackdowns upon women by male Islamic religion police - be they official or unofficial."

Even if folks have insurance do not get medical care because of the costs and they can easily find other needs for that income. Low costs women's heath clinics have saved thousands of lives."

Every time you lip off in deluded ignorance, and humiliate yourself in public when your babbling nonsense is introduced to reality based facts you cannot refute, you always tuck tail like an intellectually bankrupt coward, and try to deflect off subject by babbling even more deluded tripe. Junior, being an uneducated rube humiliating yourself in public is no way to go through life. Pathetic. I'd tell ya to learn how to be a man, and man up, but seriously, that's never going to happen. Pathetic."
22946,"If the Republican Party is nearing death, the Democrat Party died in last years election. Democrat have NO message, other then let government do it. And that message got Trump elected. If government does it We the People lose. Democrat have promised a better, more fair life for the little guy, and yet the little guy is still the little guy and getting littler. While those in power and friends of those in power get bigger. The Republican Party made a decision to going along and be liberal light, and for a time it worked, until Trump, and now the Republican Party is blowing a great opportunity. Trump got a election because of his message, ""to make America great."" And it's the Republican that haven't got that message, or understand why Trump was elected.

Various levels of government in Canada have at one time or other banned everything from smoking in restaurants to drive-throughs to shark fins to trans fats. And by the way, since we have a socialist medical system (meant in a good way) that pays for health care, it is not unreasonable for government to step in if it sees medical money wasted over questionable restaurant activities."

For all of his supporters who are not in business with him, or not politically connected and going to directly profit from this fool I ask you.  

Do you know that Trump is one of the swamp dwellers?  He is an alligator?  A sneak predator who grabs victims and drowns them.   Why would an alligator drain the swamp?  How would an alligator drain the swamp.

All while proclaiming how ""friendly"" they all are, except of course if you are non-white or refuse to ""believe"".  The state was ruled by Anaconda from its inception and is now ruled by other Corporate dictators owning the majority  of the lands where Republicans reign supreme.  One small area around Missoula is a shrinking bastion of human rights.  The rest of the state is harcore racist, bigotted, and stupid.

- separate roadway to parking lot, not to traverse any neighborhood streets

- hikers to waive all rights to sue for any reason
- specific open hours
