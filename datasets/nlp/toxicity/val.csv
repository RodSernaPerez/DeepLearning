15748,"I in 4 marriages between hetrosexual couples end in divorce in this nation so no doubt for many reasons in this nation the ideals of what it is to be married in 2017 need to be re-written because the old ideals are worn out. In my opinion people are often getting married way to young and struggling to work and support kids. Just over a century ago the average lifespan in America was the age of 42.  Today the average lifespan is 74 years of age for men and 76 years of age for women so what is the rush anymore. A commitment you make at a young age to be with someone the rest o your natural life is hard to make. As a society we should encourage people to get married later in life, but that will never happen. So we will continue to fill up the divorce courts with faithful to each other hetorsexual couples ( many religious) while we debate the morality of same sex marriages and open marriages.

 ""Indictable crimes"" is not the test in an election; what the actual voters who show up believe or even suspect to be the truth is what loses someone an election.

""1. noun, Compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others.""

Even by a brief dictionary definition of charisma, the term does not suit Trump. Trump has devoted adherents, as does any country's leader. But he does not have compelling attractiveness or charm. He's not a charismatic president. He's the antithesis of one. And when one fleshes out the notion of a charismatic leader into its common attributes, the term suits Trump even less. 

The above also speaks to why Trump was elected. Typically, America's political leaders ARE charismatic. They're charming, admirable, and attractive in so many ways. But Trump tapped into a current of public distrust in career politicians. Doing so helped bring him success. He would have had a hard time doing that if he seemed like every political leader.",0.0

Free speech means the government cannot pass a law that imposes fines, or jail time, or some other legal penalty for engaging in expression of protected speech. It means the weight and power of the state cannot be used to censor you or coerce you into silence. It does *not* mean that anyone else has to listen to you, or that you have an unlimited right to say whatever you want in any forum. If you say something offensive that causes you to lose your job with a private employer, or causes you to be expelled from an organization or be banned from an internet forum, your free speech rights are not being denied. It means people are tired of your BS, and are showing you the door. If I own a website and do not like what you post I can ban you forever, with no infringement of free speech.",0.0

If we as a country did all we could and still a terrorist attack nevertheless prevailed, then that is one thing.  But how would you console the survivors and the friends and families of the dead and injured if a deadly attack occurred and we had NOT done our best to avert it?

But for a time, under Roosevelt and Truman,  American foreign policy was actually concerned with global strategic issues - and FDR was strongly against rebuilding European colonial empires.

21775,"I'm a bit surprised by the negative comments here. This article is talking about retirement savings, not speculative investing. In the long term, lower risk investments have a lower rate of return than high. Equity is disproportionately affected by singular events, like recessions, the 2008 financial crisis, and even various types of market bubbles, but they smooth out over time.

If you have money that you aren't going to need for a decade or more, then you probably want most of it in equity most of the time. Sure, there are caveats here, like it being wise to be sensitive to overall market conditions as you approach retirement, and figuring out when it is right to shift to more conservative assets, but on balance these decisions should be rational. Don't be driven by fear of short term losses on long term investments.

His candidacy and the passage of the Civil Rights Amendment handed the South to the Republican (we-ain't-racist-wink-wink) Party giving corporate entities the votes to free themselves from all legal restraint on the pursuit of profit.
Goldwaters' loss didn't end conservative aspirations.  They were heightened as the John Birch Society types saw their chance to rise putting pressure on Johnson to appease Right-wing chicken hawks so that we not only ended up deeper into Vietnam but with Tricky Dick Nixon who dealt the fatal crack in the American Experiment from which slithered Donald Trump, hell-bent on finishing the job of splitting America apart.

I see the Putin Troll Army is here in full deflection mode.

What they can't deflect from is that this organized Russian doping cheating program could only have come right from the top.

It is not possible that the Russian dictatorship of Vladimir Putin did not know about this, initiate it and support it as an ongoing enterprise.

Nothing like this could happen in Russia without the approval of Putin.

To run a program like this without his involvement would be a death sentence for any Russian.

Putin's fingers are all over this.

The attempts to deflect to ""Lance Armstrong"" or other isolated instances of American athletes ignores the reality that the US government has never been involved in doping and has never been shown to have done so.

But no one is surprised that the Putin regime would put such a scheme together.

It's the modus operandi of a dictatorship and is completely in character for a corrupt mafia government run by an ex-KGB officer.

I disagree.  I can't sing very well but I can easily sing the ""Star Spangled Banner"".  The problem with the anthem is not the range or even the lyrics.

No national anthem registers more profoundly than the opening notes of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" played instrumentally.  Think of the Olympic gold medal presentations as an example.

Yes the the song describes war but it expresses the joy of the nation's survival (the flag being the symbol) and honoring the brave men (now men and women) fighting, some being wounded, and dying in its defense and the then unique concept of individual freedom.

Sexual assault - not so much. What then is the evidence of a stolen kiss or a touch (both of which count as sexual assault)?
To simply assert that the unfounded rates should be similar is a sign of a deliberate attempt to manipulate public opinion. And all the figures you come up with about rates of unfounded this or that do not change that one iota.

If Corps pay $1 for every $2 paid in increased costs for consumers, that's a load off of all consumers, all Oregonians. Since the new revenues are dedicated to education, senior services, and healthcare, I don't understand the claim that the measure has no concern for the elderly or poor or disabled.

CO₂ has always existed as a radiative forcing, it wasn't born as a ""greenhouse"" gas yesterday (or 300 years ago). However, the anthropogenically-sourced ~43% increase in the CO₂ mixing ratio was an abrupt departure from the millions-of-years period of stability before industrialization, and clearly began after that period, not 300 years ago. The highest rates of increase have occurred since the mid 20th century.
The ranges of ECS values given in the IPCC ARs have actually been remarkably consistent. 1 through 3 had the ranges as 1.5ºC-4.5ºC. The AR 4 slightly increased only the lower limit of the range to 2ºC-4.5ºC. The AR 5 brought the range back to that of ARs 1-3, at 1.5ºC-4.5ºC.

On the move again! 
Its unbelievable. I can't keep track of how many times they have had to move this month. 
I look at my life and the issues I have to deal with, but it does not compare with not having a place to call home. Whether its stick built or a tent. 
The city has made it impossible for campers to establish a home. There are not enough locations in Eugene to accommodate these people. The city is proud of establishing places for 20 to 30 people to stay. We have thousands living on the street.
RV's move around the city from street to street while avoiding tickets or having there home towed away. One step in front of EPD. Is this right? Is this all the City of Eugene can offer the homeless?
OURS is now in the process of moving to a new location. Hopefully they may be given a couple of weeks of peace and quiet. Away from the authorities. 
Hope that Mike's upcoming meeting will benefit the OURS camp and others like them.

The Texas trained petroleum theologists at AOGCC are clueless about electrochemistry and plasma-RF Hydrocarbon Gasification and many other efficient technologies.. they insist on wasting the gas to produce the CRUDE-behavior. In REALITY the CRUDE is the MOTHER of the GAS, we can depressurize the field and still recover 100% of the hydrocarbons with much greater efficiency over a period of 100-500 years.

Frankly, electing a protectionist government to start a trade war would very well be the dumbest idea imaginable given our overwhelming dependence on exports to drive our economy.  If you're voting for some variation of Trump policies in Canada, there's no other justification for it other than racism or some sort of irrational rage.

Our legal system depends on compliance with court orders ranging from search warrants to injunctions, particularly for law enforcement officials. Arpaio put himself above the law while claiming to enforce it.

Arpaio lost a civil case in 2013, when the court ruled that his office had systematically violated the constitutional rights of Latinos by stopping people based on racial profiling, and detaining them based solely on the suspicion that they were in the country illegally. The court ordered him to stop these practices, he ignored the court for years.

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.

In other words, he said, in a pluralistic democracy, there’s often “a difference between people’s private morality and the law.

“I find abortion to be wrong,” he said, as another illustration of this gap, “but the law is often different from our personal opinions.”

That was it, the teacher said. “It was just a quick exemplar, nothing more. And we moved on.”

A little later, the class had a five-minute break, and when it resumed, several students didn’t return, among them a popular young woman who had gone to an administrator to complain that what the teacher said had “triggered” her such that she felt “unsafe” and that, in any case, he had no right to an opinion on the subject of abortion because he was a man.

But for all that, I think there is a difference between covering up acts of abuse before they are widely public, and sitting as a judge in a case where the abuse accusation are already globally public. If the evidence shows that Abp. Apuron is guilty, I expect that even my favourite cad, Cdl. Burke, will find him guilty. Appropriate sentence, well, not so much.

We have socialized gambling in Hawaii. But there are no high-stakes games because local organized crime punishes those gamblers who try to run their own games. Most local social gaming don't want gamblers to lose more than hundred bucks in a game because then the game isn't fun anymore. Social Gambling equals no house take.",0.0

Anecdotally, remember Newland's ""F**k the EU"", hot mic comment? The neo-Nazi's which started the Odessa building fire in 2014 have, in the past, been stooges for the US. It is beyond likely that the US state department is behind the Ukraine problem.  The US wants Ukraine to help contain Russia and prevent its movement away from the Petrodollar, and even join NATO.  Recall that Ukraine was working to join NATO until Yanukovych was elected, and he reversed that plan; next step, color revolution.

It is clear that Crimea wanted to rejoin Russia.  As for the eastern areas of Ukraine, if Russia wanted to annex them, he easily could.  

In Syria, Russia is just fighting defensive war which is being driven by the US.  The US is attempting to destabilize the country for its own interests.",0.0

""The best story was in  Little Rock, Ark., in the heady days after Bill Clinton was first elected President.
It was there that Emanuel, then Clinton’s chief fund-raiser, repaired with George Stephanopoulos, Mandy Grunwald and other aides to Doe’s, the campaign hangout. 

Revenge was heavy in the air as the group discussed the enemies."" ""Suddenly Emanuel grabbed his steak knife and, as those who were there remember it, shouted out the name of another enemy, lifted the knife, then brought it down with full force into the table.
‘’Dead! Dead! Dead!’’ he screamed.""

I have heard and read mainstream media commentators suggesting that an investigtation would be a good idea— Leon Panera was on CNN saying that. A while back, there were conservative media people looking at why Trump and some of Trump’s people (some of whom are now under investigation) were not looking aggressively at the Uranium issue— something Trump just started pushing real hard now. One reason is that some of Trump’s people were involved in pushing that deal and meeting with Uranium people in Russia and the person Putin put in charge of Russian Uranium supply. At this point Trump may feel there is nothing to lose.",0.0

However the actions of a few cross the line and make an untenable situation.  There are no easy answers and ultimately this is a homeless issue not a palace issue.
